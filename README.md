# Inferring Species Interactions

This project will try to reproduce some of the existing causal inference methods and, in doing so, infer species interactions from the population dynamics dataset, as well as analyse performance differences between different algorithms. In the early stages of the project, only a few smaller data sets (involving less than three species) will be used, with the aim of tuning the parameters of the algorithm as efﬁcient as possible to ensure its reliability. When all methods are successfully implemented, larger data sets will be applied to test the performance of different algorithms. Where possible, some potential improvements will be attempted to apply in response to existing ﬂaws or weaknesses in some algorithms. 

## Aims and Objectives 

The overall goal of this project is to investigate the performance of different causal inference methods for determining species interaction. In the reproduction phase, several existing methods of causal inference will attempted to be reproduce and tested in with simple, small data sets. During the evaluation phase, simulated large data sets, as well as population dynamics data sets collected based on the real world, will be used to evaluate and analyze the performance of the reproduced causal inference methods. In the enhancement phase, the project will make some attempts to improve existing defects in the methods (e.g., the problem of dealing with time-delay in predator’s response) and to incorporate artiﬁcial neural networks with a view to producing better operation outcomes. 

### The objectives of this project are as follows: 
- Learn and understand the concepts of population dynamics and species interactions, with a focus on predator-prey systems. 
- Study the pattern of the underlying dynamics dataset; attempt to simulate the large-sized dataset; obtain a real-world dataset. 
- Try to reproduce the GC and CCM algorithms with programs and test with underlying data set. 
- Apply simulated and real data sets to algorithms, validate the result and make performance assessments. 
- Understand the deﬁciencies in the method, with a focus on countermeasures to the time-delay in predator dynamics. 
- Understand the principles of RNN or ESN, mainly the parts of it that are complementary to the current method. 
- Apply ideas about improvement to the original algorithm and evaluate the enhanced algorithm. 

### The deliverables will be brought by this project are as follows: 
- A literature review of works related to population dynamics and species interactions done by other researchers, as well as the use of different causal inferring measurements. 
- Multiple population dynamics datasets gathered from the real world available for the method to infer the species interactions. 
- A demonstration of reproduced measurement methods for causal inferring and performance analysis. 
- Some suggestions about possible improvement on effect and robustness,and attempts of new feature implementation related to artiﬁcial neural network.

The effectiveness of the methods involved in the project for inferring interactions between species according to population dynamics can be further proved by the implementation of this project,thus providing explanations and suggestions for subsequent biological researchers to select appropriate methods and to improve the existing methods or to develop more advanced causal inference algorithms for species interactions.
